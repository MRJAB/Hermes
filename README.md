# Hermes Project

#Develop a distributed chat system, with two separate clients
Users can search for other people on a server, and initiate a chat
with them. Doing so opens up a secure connection between the
two users that bypasses the server.

There are three components: a server which can tell users how
to contact other people; client A which users can use; and client
B which users can use. Clients can be implemented e.g. as:
desktop applications; web sites; Android/iOS apps; terminal
programs; etc.

The two clients you implement must be of different types
(e.g. you may not implement two web clients). Failure to do so
will result in a deduction of 25 marks from the final team grade.

#Server
Needs to speak a network protocol to clients.

Some choices: binary protocol? text protocol? Stateless /
stateful? Text only? Pictures and other media? etc.

Needs to be able to deal with multiple simultaneous clients.

Some choices: a single server? multiple servers? master server
with failover slaves? etc.

#Clients
Need to speak a network protocol to users.

Some choices: store history locally? and/or remotely (allows
users to move clients)? edit / delete previous messages? group
chats? etc.
